In this Project, I have created a dashboard that can be used to find cointegrating pairs in S&P 500 and constrcut a portfolio based on it.
I also forecast and backtest the prices predicted using VAR model for the cointegrated pairs and compare the performance with holding S&P 500. 


Step 1 -> Importing the data
Step 2 -> Finding Structural Breaks in each stock         - Bai and Perron Test
Step 3 -> Testing for Unit/Explosive roots for each stock - Augmented Dickey Fuller Test
Step 4 -> Testing for Cointegrating relationships         - Johansen Cointegration Test
Step 5 -> Diagnostics for the cointegrated relationships
Step 6 -> Forecast and Performance Evaluation
Step 7 -> Backtest and Performance Evaluation
Step 8 -> Constructing Portfolio using the Pairs

P.S Step 2 and 3 takes a long time. I am working on creating a lite version where most of the results are stored.
